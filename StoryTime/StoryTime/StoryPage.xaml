Sara turned and surveyed the room. It had the usual paraphernalia of open textbooks, games, breakfast cups and saucers. She took her half eaten plate of grapes and tossed it to the dustbin. She heard a scuffle near the door and opened it to find her pet Hermit, the frog, looking at her pitifully from the floor.She sighed. She had forgotten to feed it. Just how much time did I sleep? She wondered as she came downstairs to her kitchen. She could see that her brother Issac had been through the pack of cereals mom had carefully hidden away from his clumsy hands.

I have been waiting for you for such a long time and now you are here!' he laughed out loud and in that moment, Sara took a chance and rushed out of the kitchen. But she tipped on the edge of carpet and fell down, knocking her head…."
